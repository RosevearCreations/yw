> April 11, 2026 sync: reviewed during the HSE OSHA interface, packet events, and field signoff pass.

## 2026-04-11 journal sync exceptions and upload fallback pass
- Added migration `sql/068_journal_sync_exceptions_and_upload_failure_fallback.sql`.
- Added DB-backed `gl_journal_sync_exceptions` so stale, unbalanced, and missing-entry source batches are visible as first-class review items instead of hidden batch-state guesses.
- Added DB-backed `field_upload_failures` so failed job-comment and equipment-evidence uploads leave an auditable fallback trail for retry/resolution instead of failing silently.
- Extended Admin selectors/directory/manage/UI so sync exceptions and upload failures can be reviewed, resolved, or dismissed from the same backbone shell.
- Tightened job activity upload handling so comments can still save even when attachments fail, with clearer operator feedback and follow-up visibility.

## Immediate priorities for the next pass
- true journal posting and audit controls
- material issue / usage records after receiving
- route-stop execution state and proof capture
- richer HSE closeout evidence, reopen, and attachments

## 2026-04-10 journal posting controls and material issue / usage pass
- Added migration `sql/066_journal_posting_controls_and_material_issue_usage.sql`.
- Added DB-side journal-batch rollups so line count, debit total, credit total, and balanced state are derived instead of tracked manually.
- Added DB-backed `material_issues` and `material_issue_lines` so receiving can progress into job usage, issued-cost totals, and variance visibility.
- Extended the Admin backbone so journal batches, journal entries, material issues, and material issue lines can be created and managed from the same operational shell.
- Continued the DB-first direction for shared operational data while keeping the next highest-value gaps visible: route execution lifecycle, HSE proof/reopen, and stronger source-to-journal automation.

## 2026-04-09 workflow rollups, posting, receiving-costing, and HSE closeout pass
- Added DB-first workflow logic so estimate, work-order, and material-receipt header totals can roll up from their line records instead of depending on manual entry.
- Added receivables/payables payment-application logic so invoices and bills can track paid amounts, remaining balance, and partial/paid status from posted payments.
- Added receiving-to-costing linkage so material receipt lines can feed received quantity / received cost visibility back into work-order execution.
- Extended linked HSE packets toward real progress and closeout handling with checklist-style completion fields, derived progress, and clearer Admin-side visibility.


## 2026-04-08 landscaping/construction/mobile/admin-ui pathway documentation pass
- Refreshed the Markdown set to move the product direction from schema-only groundwork into the next implementation phase: admin UI managers for estimates/work orders, materials/units, routes/service areas, subcontract dispatch, and AR/AP + chart of accounts.
- Added a clearer rationale for keeping HSE as a first-class standalone module that can later link to jobs, sites, and dispatches for landscaping, project, and subcontract work.
- Updated the docs to emphasize mobile-first field use, desktop-strong admin depth, DB-first shared data, and local SEO / one-H1 discipline on every public build pass.

## What this project is now
Treat the product as a landscaping-led field operations platform with integrated HSE capabilities.

## Core business modes
- recurring landscaping operations
- project/construction-style jobs
- subcontract dispatch work
- standalone HSE workflows

## What future passes should prefer
- database-backed shared operational data
- mobile-first field UX
- desktop-strong admin depth
- stable session identity above all other feature work

## Current planning note
When continuing this project, assume the next strongest implementation pass is the admin UI layer on top of the new operations/accounting tables, while keeping HSE standalone-friendly and mobile-first.

## 2026-04-10 crew assignment, recurring jobs, and field activity pass
- Job creation now has a clearer ownership path: a crew can be assigned at the same time as an explicit supervisor so responsibility is visible from the start.
- Jobs now support standalone or recurring scheduling fields, with recurrence summary/rule storage in the database instead of leaving schedule logic only in draft UI state.
- Job comments now have a DB-backed activity trail with optional photo attachments and special-instruction flags so crews and supervisors can review site notes, uploaded images, and field changes in one place.
- This pass continues the DB-first direction for shared operational data and reduces duplication risk compared with keeping crew/job packet details only in local JSON or loosely coupled browser state.
- Future AI passes should preserve the rule that every new job can carry both a crew and a clearly named responsible supervisor.

## 2026-04-10 source-generated journals, route execution, and HSE proof pass
- Added migration `sql/067_source_journal_route_execution_and_hse_proof.sql`.
- Added source-generated draft journal batches for AR invoices, AP bills, material receipts, and material issues so review/posting can start from the originating record instead of manual batch creation.
- Added route-stop execution lifecycle records plus attachment rows so daily field work can track completed, skipped, delayed, and exception states with note/photo support.
- Added HSE proof rows plus reopen-aware linked packet fields so closeout evidence, reopen counts, and follow-up exceptions are visible in the Admin backbone.
- Continued the DB-first move for shared operational/accounting data and refreshed the docs so roadmap, risks, testing, and deployment all point to the same next state.
