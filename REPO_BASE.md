## 2026-04-09 workflow rollups, posting, receiving-costing, and HSE closeout pass
- Added DB-first workflow logic so estimate, work-order, and material-receipt header totals can roll up from their line records instead of depending on manual entry.
- Added receivables/payables payment-application logic so invoices and bills can track paid amounts, remaining balance, and partial/paid status from posted payments.
- Added receiving-to-costing linkage so material receipt lines can feed received quantity / received cost visibility back into work-order execution.
- Extended linked HSE packets toward real progress and closeout handling with checklist-style completion fields, derived progress, and clearer Admin-side visibility.


## 2026-04-08 landscaping/construction/mobile/admin-ui pathway documentation pass
- Refreshed the Markdown set to move the product direction from schema-only groundwork into the next implementation phase: admin UI managers for estimates/work orders, materials/units, routes/service areas, subcontract dispatch, and AR/AP + chart of accounts.
- Added a clearer rationale for keeping HSE as a first-class standalone module that can later link to jobs, sites, and dispatches for landscaping, project, and subcontract work.
- Updated the docs to emphasize mobile-first field use, desktop-strong admin depth, DB-first shared data, and local SEO / one-H1 discipline on every public build pass.

## Active source of truth
Use this repository build as the current source of truth for the operations + HSE platform.

## Core direction
The repo is now centered on:
- landscaping operations
- project/construction support jobs
- subcontract dispatch jobs
- standalone and linked HSE workflows
- admin-managed shared reference data

## Current repo direction
The repo should now be treated as a landscaping / project-work / subcontract / HSE operations platform. Future passes should prefer DB-first shared data and admin managers over new JSON maps whenever the same values are used in more than one workflow.

## 2026-04-10 crew assignment, recurring jobs, and field activity pass
- Job creation now has a clearer ownership path: a crew can be assigned at the same time as an explicit supervisor so responsibility is visible from the start.
- Jobs now support standalone or recurring scheduling fields, with recurrence summary/rule storage in the database instead of leaving schedule logic only in draft UI state.
- Job comments now have a DB-backed activity trail with optional photo attachments and special-instruction flags so crews and supervisors can review site notes, uploaded images, and field changes in one place.
- This pass continues the DB-first direction for shared operational data and reduces duplication risk compared with keeping crew/job packet details only in local JSON or loosely coupled browser state.
- Repo direction remains DB-first for shared crew/schedule/job packet data and should avoid drifting back to standalone JSON maps for active operations.
