## 2026-03-26 security/account/equipment reliability pass
- Switched the app toward a true account-setup flow after magic-link validation or password recovery.
- Added profile flags for password-ready/account-setup-complete state.
- Settings now supports richer contact/address saving, password reset email, and account-setup completion.
- Jobs and Equipment screens now autosave local drafts to reduce remote-connection data loss.
- Service worker cache version was bumped again to reduce stale app shell issues after auth changes.

### Best next steps
1. Move equipment photo/signature evidence into Supabase Storage objects with audit rows instead of row JSON/base64 payloads.
2. Add explicit first-run onboarding screens for new users instead of routing them straight into Settings.
3. Expand autosave/outbox coverage from Jobs/Equipment into profile and admin forms.
4. Add server-side validation messages for duplicate usernames and invalid address/postal formats.
5. Add account email/username change confirmation workflows.
