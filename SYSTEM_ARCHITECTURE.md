## Reservation / Approval / Verification Pass (March 24, 2026)

This pass updates the repo toward the next high-value workflow layer:
- equipment reservations now support pool-aware conflict checking instead of single-item-only assumptions
- admin notifications now support approval decision fields and email delivery tracking
- jobs gain approval tracking fields
- job equipment requirements gain pool keys and approval tracking fields
- optional Twilio Verify SMS phone verification flow is scaffolded in `account-maintenance`

### New migration
- `sql/048_notification_approvals_reservation_pools_and_sms.sql`

### Updated backend behavior
- `jobs-manage` now checks overlapping jobs and counts free assets inside a pool before reserving
- `jobs-directory` now returns pool availability plus recent job/equipment notifications
- `admin-directory` now returns notifications in `all` / `notifications` scope
- `admin-manage` now supports notification actions: `mark_read`, `approve`, `reject`, `resolve`, `dismiss`
- `account-maintenance` now supports optional SMS actions: `send_phone_verification_code` and `verify_phone_code` when provider env vars are configured

### Required environment variables for outbound delivery
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` or `EMAIL_FROM`
- `ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_TO`

### Required environment variables for SMS verification
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`

### Best next pass after this
- wire the new notification approval actions into a dedicated visible admin approval panel in the live frontend
- add per-notification email preview/test send controls
- add requirement-level approve/reject buttons directly from job/equipment screens
- add provider-specific retry / dead-letter handling for email and SMS failures
