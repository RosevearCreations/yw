## 2026-03-26 confirmation history and autosave reliability pass
- Kept Supabase Storage + `equipment_evidence_assets` as the primary evidence path for equipment photos/signatures; no new inline JSON/base64 evidence storage was introduced in this pass.
- Added self-service identity-change history loading in Settings so users can see pending, approved, and rejected username/email requests without waiting on admin replies.
- Added user-facing confirmation notifications when admins approve or reject identity-change requests.
- Expanded autosave/recovery coverage into the self-profile screen and the admin queue workspace (filters plus email preview fields).
- Refreshed the app documentation to reflect that no new SQL migration was required beyond `055_storage_onboarding_identity_change_and_bootstrap.sql` for this pass.

### Best next steps
1. Add a dedicated user inbox/activity panel that surfaces admin notifications and approval results without requiring the Settings screen.
2. Move profile-form autosave drafts into a shared outbox/replay queue for true offline-first syncing.
3. Add admin-side approval controls that can trigger real Auth email-change workflows after request approval.
4. Add thumbnail galleries and delete/replace actions for Storage-backed equipment evidence assets.
