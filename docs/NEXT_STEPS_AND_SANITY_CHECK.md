# Next Steps and Sanity Check

## Restart checkpoint

Start every work session from current `dev` and `main`, then verify that their application trees are synchronized before opening another feature branch. Read current schema/release truth from I.T. Readiness rather than historical documentation.

## Required sanity checks

Before new feature work, verify `dev`/`main` parity, current schema drift, release authority separately from repository enforcement, intended Finance/provider fail-closed state, Current Admin To-Do truth, no accidental business-rail closure, repository/Help/SEO/browser gates, and removal of temporary branches/workflows/files after release proof.

## Public web and Help review

Every release that changes navigation, workflows, public pages, or public-search behavior must update `/help.html` in the same change. Public/indexable pages retain one H1, current metadata, canonical URLs on `https://yardweasels.ca`, crawler-ready content, canonical-only sitemap entries with truthful freshness, structured data that mirrors visible content, and responsive phone/desktop rendering. Portal and Help surfaces remain `noindex`.

Treat `https://ywiinc.com` as a separate established business website, not an automatic canonical destination. Noncanonical and preview application hosts remain `noindex` while pointing canonically to yardweasels.ca. Verify the canonical-host, canonical-conflict, and preview/noncanonical rendering cases in browser acceptance. A disagreement between approved route path, sitemap canonical, and rendered canonical fails closed to `noindex` until corrected.

Sitemap `lastmod` must represent meaningful source/content freshness rather than simply the deployment date and must never be future-dated. Public route structured data should expose matching WebPage, Service, and BreadcrumbList semantics without contradicting the visible H1, title, description, route or provider. External search-engine submission is a separately configured action; do not automatically call IndexNow or Search Console and never use submission as a substitute for content approval.

## Remaining work selection

Choose the next technical feature from a fresh I.T. Readiness / Current Admin To-Do review. Do not invent autonomous work merely to increase a score. Rails classified as human, accounting, provider, content or staging acceptance remain open until their actual evidence exists.

Repository protection remains a separate enforcement concern from application release authority and should stay visible until GitHub reports it as enforced.

## Module and Production boundary

The four top-level modules are **Safety / OHSA**, **Finance**, **Jobs**, and **Admin**. **I.T. Readiness** remains inside Admin rather than becoming another top-level module.

Production promotion remains deliberate/manual and separate from application source readiness.
