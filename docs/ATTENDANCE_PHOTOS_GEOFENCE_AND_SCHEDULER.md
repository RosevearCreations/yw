## 2026-04-23 note
Scheduler reliability now includes two guards: the Edge Function recalculates `next_run_at` after a successful run, and SQL skips rows already queued in the last 10 minutes.

# Attendance Photos, Geofence, Scheduler, and Signed-Contract Invoice Flow

This pass adds:
- attendance photo upload/storage linked to employee time entries
- geofence evaluation against site coordinates and configured radius
- service execution scheduler runs for signed agreements with linked jobs
- provider-specific payroll export layouts
- contract-to-invoice generation only when the contract document is signed

Next likely follow-up work:
- background/cron invocation of the scheduler edge function
- full map/geofence admin setup UX
- provider-specific file QA against real payroll vendor imports
- signed acceptance capture beyond status/manual fields


## 2026-04-21 sync note

Attendance photo review now stores approve / reject / follow-up outcomes in `media_review_actions`, and scheduler settings now include dispatch metadata plus cron-ready next-run handling.

## 2026-04-22 scheduler note
When documenting scheduler setup, describe the secret source as Vault-preferred but fallback-capable so local or non-Vault environments do not drift from the canonical repo SQL.

## 2026-04-24 auth wall, historical reports, and Ontario workplace safety reporting pass
- Fixed the public auth wall so logged-out users no longer see the live Toolbox Talk, PPE Check, First Aid Kit, Site Inspection, or Emergency Drill screens underneath the sign-in interface.
- Added a supervisor/admin **Historical Reports** screen with export-ready HSE form history, site/form rollups, and cross-workflow history covering submissions, HSE packet events, evidence review, scheduler runs, payroll exports, and signed contracts.
- Added migration `sql/089_historical_reporting_and_auth_wall_support.sql` and synced the full schema reference so reporting stays DB-backed instead of drifting into browser-only JSON snapshots.
- Continued the Ontario workplace safety direction by keeping the five field forms first-class while making their historical retrieval and review more usable for office and supervisor follow-up.
- Next strongest follow-up: add incident / near-miss reporting, saved report presets, richer trend charts, and deeper drill-down exports by site, worker, route, and work-order context.

## 2026-04-24 incident reporting, DB-backed report presets, and richer HSE analytics pass
- Added a new **Incident / Near Miss** field form so workers and supervisors can capture injuries, close calls, damage, witness names, immediate actions, and corrective-action ownership without waiting for office follow-up.
- Added migration `sql/090_incident_reporting_saved_report_presets_and_trends.sql`.
- Added DB-backed reporting presets (`report_presets`) so supervisors and admins can reuse saved report filters without depending on local browser storage.
- Expanded reporting with DB-backed views for incident history, monthly trends, worker rollups, and site/job/route context rollups.
- Reworked the historical reports screen to use the richer DB-backed datasets and added incident CSV export.
- Added a dedicated incident quick link in the public nav, HSE Ops, and Admin hub so the Ontario workplace safety workflows stay easy to reach on mobile and desktop.
- Next strongest follow-up: training history + certification expiry, SDS acknowledgement tracking, Ontario OHSA-aligned incident and due-diligence recordkeeping helpers, and corrective-action task assignment from incident rows.

## 2026-04-25 corrective actions + training pass
- Synced the repo to include first-class corrective-action tasks, training / certification expiry tracking, SDS acknowledgement history, and management-focused reporting.
- See `docs/CORRECTIVE_ACTIONS_AND_TRAINING.md` and the new `sql/091_corrective_actions_training_and_sds_tracking.sql` migration.

## Latest pass note (2026-04-25d)
- Synced for scheduled report delivery, worker self-service training/SDS acknowledgement, and Jobs commercial/accounting foundation planning.

## 2026-04-26 pass note

This pass moves the project into the Jobs commercial/accounting phase.
It adds the 094 Jobs commercial workflow foundation, updates the repo status toward estimate/work-order/completion/accounting readiness, and keeps the schema/docs aligned for the next phase.


## Pass 096 notes

This pass adds branded quote output, automatic threshold evaluation, closeout evidence linkage, invoice/journal posting-rule structures, accountant handoff exports, and profitability/variance scorecards for the Jobs commercial workflow.
