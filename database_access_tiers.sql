-- Current pass note: customer engagement workflow depth now includes purchaser-versus-recipient gift-card support, broader engagement queues, and storefront featured-testimonial placement.
-- Current pass note: stock-unit versus usage-unit inventory handling was expanded for clearer craft-material costing and planning.
-- File: /database_access_tiers.sql

-- Current pass note: phone product capture now resolves the shared D1 binding through DB or DD_DB and returns structured JSON failures instead of HTML parser breaks.

-- Current pass note: the initial D1 catalog migration completed successfully for Tools, Supplies, Movies, and Featured Creations.
-- The main Catalog admin page no longer exposes the day-to-day migration panel, while `/api/admin/catalog-sync` remains available for maintenance or reseed recovery only.

-- 2026-04-13 pass note:
-- No brand-new required tables were introduced in this pass.
-- Current pass focused on DD-series label display, standalone brand-asset uploads,
-- and public social-link restoration through shared UI/footer behavior.

-- Current pass note
-- Added bulk site-inventory unit-cost update workflow in application code.
-- No schema expansion was required in this pass; existing site_item_inventory and site_inventory_movements tables were reused.

-- Pass 20 note — mobile capture compatibility repair
-- The live production database may still be missing one or more newer mobile-capture columns
-- on `products` (for example `capture_reference`) even though the current schema files include them.
-- Application code now checks the live table shape before writing optional mobile-capture fields so
-- `/api/admin/mobile-create-product` and `/api/admin/mobile-product-drafts` keep working during a
-- partial migration window. The preferred long-term fix is still to complete the products-table upgrade.

-- Current Pass Note — 2026-04-14
-- Approval-required storefront fields are now surfaced in the mobile capture UI and approval is blocked until readiness checks pass.


-- Current Pass Note — 2026-04-15
-- Added app_settings-backed dropdown master-data keys for product categories, colours, and shipping codes.
-- Product resource links now support per-unit, end-of-lot, and story-only inventory usage modes.
-- End-of-lot mode is intended for supplies such as wax/resin/clay where one lot may cover many finished products before inventory should be reduced.

-- Current Pass Note — 2026-04-16
-- Admin dropdown master-data is now wired through app_settings and tax_classes in application code.
-- Site inventory usage-unit support was added in application/runtime migration logic for cups, wicks, grams, spools, and end-of-lot costing.

-- Current Pass Update — 2026-04-17
-- This pass assumes/uses the following current-direction features in code:
-- 1) member wishlist and product interest request review workflows
-- 2) checkout recovery leads and recovery email notification outbox support
-- 3) gift card validation / redemption support
-- 4) product review / testimonial submission and approved review display
-- 5) pricing suggestion load/apply actions in admin
-- 6) continued schema-compatibility hardening for older D1 tables
-- Pass 29 - footer socials, engagement depth, and editor price write-back
-- Notes: live code now expects footer social fallback behavior, deeper engagement admin actions, and editor-side price preset write-back.

-- Pass 30 schema note: storefront gift-card purchases may use gift_cards.order_id, purchase_source, and pending_activation status; publish scoring now expects image-count-aware readiness.
